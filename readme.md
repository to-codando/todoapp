# LEMEJS APP TEMPLATE

To make this project work properly, the system needs to be loaded in an environment supported by nodejs v12 or higher.

I recommend installing the LTS version of the node to ensure the stability of the app and avoid other problems.

## Install dependencies

Using a command line interface with bash for example, enter the project folder and run the command below to install the project's dependencies.

```
yarn install
```


All you need to do now to see the system working is to execute the command below, also in the command terminal.

```
yarn serve
```

The above command will start the application at localhost in development mode.
